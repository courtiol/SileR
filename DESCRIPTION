Description:
    This R package aims at documenting the workflow behind the results from the 
    paper entitled "Differences in age-specific mortality between wild-caught 
    and captive-born Asian elephants" by Khyne U Mar, Mirkka Lahdenperä, 
    Alexandre Courtiol and Virpi Lummaa (in review). The main goal of the 
    package is to fit survival models derived from a model introduced by 
    Siler ("A competiting-risk model for animal mortality", Ecology, 1979). The
    main differences are that the effect of covariate(s) are being investigated 
    and that the survival models have to be fited on right and left censored 
    longitudinal data. This package has not been conceived for general use.
    It serves to document the steps of our analysis.
